# My Chess GUI (SFML) for Stockfish
This is an example of a program that uses the stockfish engine and you can play chess with this engine.

It's still an early version - it has bugs. But you can already play a game:))

If you can may cloning this project and you can cooperate:))

The main branch already has a working save load game option. Finally, we managed to make the necessary 

corrections on the working branch.

If you want to save the game state, press the 's' key, and if you want to load a previously saved game,

press the 'l' key. The program is still developing.
